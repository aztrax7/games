# 🎮 games

Welcome to my personal collection of Python games!

This repository contains Python-based games that I’ve created as part of my programming journey. These projects are designed to be fun, interactive, and educational — helping me practice logic, graphics, and user interaction in Python. I'll keep adding new games as I learn more!

---

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

- Practice Python fundamentals through game development
- Build a portfolio of creative, logic-driven projects
- Learn to use game libraries and event handling

---

## 🛠 How to Run

- All the projects can be found in their respectively named folders. Each one of them contain the code and a ``readme.md`` file to help you guys understand what the project does!
- All the projects, so far, are written in Python and formatted as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`). You can open them locally by copying the code into your preferred IDLE (Integrated Development Learning Environment) and running it!
