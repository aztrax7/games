# 🎮 games

This repository contains Python-based games that I’ve created as part of my programming journey. These projects are designed to be fun, interactive, and educational — helping me practice logic, graphics, and user interaction in Python.

I'll keep adding new games as I learn more!


## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

- Practice Python fundamentals through game development
- Build a portfolio of creative, logic-driven projects
- Learn to use game libraries and event handling


## 📌 How to Run

These games are built in **Jupyter Notebook** format (`.ipynb`). You can run them in:

- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- **Google Colab**
- **VS Code** with Jupyter extension

You’re welcome to use, share, or modify the code for your own learning or fun projects!


## 📈 Coming Soon

Planned future games and enhancements:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Number guessing game
- Brick Breaker (Pygame)
- Multiplayer or timed versions

Stay tuned! 🚧
